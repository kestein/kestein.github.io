                Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Kevin Stein (as you could tell by the URL) and here is a bit about myself.
                <li>I graduated from <a href=https://www.calpoly.edu/ target="_blank">Cal Poly San Luis Obispo</a> with a bachelor's in computer science and a minor in communications studies. At some point I am going to go back for a master's degree and hopefully take more communications courses.</li>
                <li>Over the past few years I have become proficient in the <a href=https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/ target="_blank">rust</a> programming language.</li>
                <li>I use primarily vim and sublime to edit code and documents.</li>
                <li>I use Centos 7 as my primary desktop OS and use Ubuntu Desktop as a server. Pretty backwards but it's what worked with the computers that I had on hand.</li>
                <li>I enjoy doing low level programming. You can probably tell I focus most of my time learning that by the extremely bare bones layout of this site.</li>
                <li>I like ships a lot. It is my goal to visit a fleet's worth of ships. Current progress:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Aircraft Carriers: 2 (USS Hornet, USS Intrepid)</li>
                        <li>Light Cruisers: 1 (HMS Belfast)</li>
                        <li>Submarines: 1 (USS Growler)</li>
                        <li>Battleships: 2 (USS New Jersey, USS Wisconsin)</li>
                   </ul>
